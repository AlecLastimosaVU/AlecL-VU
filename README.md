# FleetFoot X1 Landing Page - Website Development Documentation

## Overview

Hi, I'm Alec! This project is a simple landing page I created for my web development assignment. The goal was to build a webpage for a fictional product, the *FleetFoot X1* running shoe. The page was designed with simplicity, user-friendliness, and responsiveness in mind, featuring key product details such as an introductory section, a hero banner, a list of features, and a call-to-action (CTA) for purchasing the product.

This project helped me learn how to maintain a repository on GitHub and launch a simple website. It also emphasizes structured code, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## Project Structure

The project is hosted on GitHub and follows this structure:

1. Project Folder [ALECL-VU-MAIN]
    - css folder
        - styles.css (Contains the styling of the webpage using CSS)
    - images folder
        - fleetfoot x1 hero_1.jpg (Contains the hero image used for the made-up running shoe)
    - index.html (Contains the structure of the webpage using HTML)
    - README.md (Contains the documentation of the development process)

The HTML file follows a simple structure using semantic elements such as <header>, <section>, and <footer> for better readibility and accesibility. The CSS file applies styling to improve the layout, spacing, and apperance of the text.

In addition, the project includes an images folder to store the hero image, and also has a README.md file containing this documentation process.


## Image Sourcing and Licensing

The hero image used on this landing page is sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), and it is free to use with no attribution required. The image has been resized and styled using CSS to fit seamlessly within the webpage layout and ensures it looks great on all screen sizes, making the site mobile-responsive.

## Design Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The design utilizes Flexbox and media queries to ensure that the page adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Hero Section**: A large, responsive hero banner introduces the *FleetFoot X1* shoes with a compelling tagline. The image adjusts based on screen size.
- **Product Features**: The product's key features are presented in a bulleted list for easy readability and quick scanning.
- **Call to Action (CTA)**: The CTA encourages users to "Buy Now" with a highly visible button to grab attention.

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Contrast**: High-contrast colors are used between text and the background to enhance readability for users with visual impairments.
- **Links and Buttons**: All links are styled to be easily identifiable, with adequate padding for users with mobility challenges.
- **Alt Text for Images**: Alt text has been provided for the hero image to ensure that screen readers can describe the content for visually impaired users.

## Technical Features

- **External CSS File**: The project uses an external stylesheet (`styles.css`) to maintain clean and maintainable HTML code.
- **Meta Tags for SEO and Responsiveness**: The webpage includes important meta tags such as `meta charset="UTF-8"` for proper encoding and `meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"` to ensure the page is responsive on mobile devices.
- **Responsive Hero Image**: The hero image automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, maintaining the correct aspect ratio for various devices.

## Future Steps

1. **Interactive Features**:
   - **Product Reviews**: Adding a section for customer reviews would increase the interactivity of the website. Users could submit and display their reviews dynamically.
   - **Contact Form**: A contact form could be implemented, allowing visitors to ask questions or inquire directly about the product.

## Conclusion

I am happy with how the landing page turned out for this assignment. It demonstrates the skills Iâ€™ve learned so far in HTML, CSS, and GitHub, such as writing semantic HTML and creating a mobile-responsive layout. This project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to explore the fundamentals of web development.
