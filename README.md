-Website Development Documentation-


-Overview-

Hi, my name is Alec, and this project is a simple landing page I created as part of my web development assignment.

This project involves the development of a landing page for a fictional product, the FleetFoot X1 running shoe. The landing page was designed with simplicity, user-friendliness, and responsiveness in mind. The webpage features key product information, including an introductory section, a hero banner, a list of features, and a call-to-action (CTA) for purchasing the product.

The primary goal is to focus on creating a simple, accessible, and visually pleasing webpage with organised structured code. The webpage was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio Code and hosted on Github to learn how to maintain a repository and launch a simple website.


-Project Structure-

The website is hosted on Github, which includes the following structure:

1. Project Folder [ALECL-VU-MAIN]
    - css folder
        - styles.css (Contains the styling of the webpage using CSS)
    - images folder
        - fleetfoot x1 hero_1.jpg (Contains the hero image used for the made-up running shoe)
    - index.html (Contains the structure of the webpage using HTML)
    - README.md (Contains the documentation of the development process)

The HTML file follows a simple structure using semantic elements such as <header>, <section>, and <footer> for better readibility and accesibility. The CSS file applies styling to improve the layout, spacing, and apperance of the text.

In addition, the project includes an images folder to store the hero image, and also has a README.md file containing this documentation process.


-Image Sourcing and Licensing-

The hero image used on the landing page is sourced from Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/). It is license-free, and can be used without attribution.

The image was resized and styled using CSS to fit within the layout of the page and ensures the image looks good on all screen sizes, making the website mobile-responsive.


-Design Features-

1. Responsive Layout: The design uses Flexbox and media queries to ensure that the page adjusts correctly to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
2. Hero Section: A large hero banner introduces the FleetFoot X1 shoes with a compelling tagline. The image is responsive and adjusts based on screen size.
3. Product Features: Key features of the FleetFoot X1 shoes are presented in a clean, bulleted format for easy readability and quick scanning by users.
4. Call to Action: The CTA section encourages users to "Buy Now" with an attention-grabbing button.


-Accessibility Considerations-

1. Contrast: I used high-contrast colours between the text and background to ensure readibility for users with visual impairments.
2. Links and Buttons: All links are styled to be easily identifiable and have appropriate padding for users with mobility challenges.
3. Alt Text for Images: The hero image used in the website have suitable alt text, ensuring users with screen readers can understand the contents of the image.


-Technical Features-

1. External CSS File: An external stylesheet (styles.css) is used to keep the HTML clean and maintainable.
2. Meta Tags for SEO and Responsiveness: The webpage includes necessary meta tags such as meta charset="UTF-8" for proper encoding and meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" to ensure the page is responsive on mobile devices.
3. Responsive Hero Image: The hero image adjusts to different screen sizes, maintaining proper aspect ratios.


-Future Steps-

1. Interactive Features:
Product Reviews: Adding a section for customer reviews would increase the interactive aspect of the website. Users could submit their reviews, which could be displayed dynamically.
2. Contact Form: A contact form could be added to allow visitors to inquire directly about the product or ask questions.


-Conclusion-

I am happy with how the landing page turned out in this assignment, as it is a way to showcase what I have learnt so far in HTML, CSS and Github.

The webpage demonstrates the necessary web development skills, like writing semantic HTML and creating a mobile-responsive layout.

This assignment has been a valuable learning experience and has given me the opportunity to explore the basics of web development.
